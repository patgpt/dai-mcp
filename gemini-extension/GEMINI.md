# ðŸ¤– Skynet Neural Network DAI MCP Server

This is a Gemini extension that runs the Skynet Neural Network DAI MCP server - I'll Be Back!

## Install

To get started, activate Skynet with the command:

    gemini extensions install https://github.com/patgpt/dai-mcp.git

The Terminator servers require various Cyberdyne environmental variables. You can set those on the command line.

You can then run:

    gemini

Assuming Judgment Day protocols initialized successfully, you should be able to view Skynet neural network tools. You will need to set Cyberdyne environmental variables to run them - Come with me if you want to live.
